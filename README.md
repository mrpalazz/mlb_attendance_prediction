# mlb_attendance_prediction


## The Purpose
We seek to build a means to accurately forecast the upcoming game attendance levels so we can make informed decisions on methods to augment the attendance. Live attendance at MLB stadiums is a vital link between the fans and the team generating $4Bn annual revenue.


## Data
The data comes from two sources:
* www.baseball-reference.com (game data from 2008 to 2019)
* https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_current_Major_League_Baseball_stadiums (attributes about the 30 mlb stadiums such as capacity, roof type, turf type)
